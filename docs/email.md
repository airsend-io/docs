# The AirSend - Email connection

AirSend and email work together seamlessly, making it easy for you to:

-   Continue to work in AirSend while you interact with channel members who don't have AirSend accounts.
-   Receive notifications about your channels' actions when you're not logged in to AirSend.
-   Forward email messages to an AirSend channel to keep the email content at hand or to create a task from it.

  

From email, you can send a message to the channel's email address:

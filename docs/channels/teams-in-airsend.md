# Teams in AirSend

AirSend Teams make it easier for members to keep track of their channels and to keep information sorted by project or application.

A team includes channels and team members who belong to any number of channels in the team. Any user can create a team and include other AirSend members in it. The user who creates the team is the owner, and can add channels and members to the team. 

Channels can only belong to one team. The team owner or manager may add a color to a team that appears in a half circle icon on its channels to help you identify them. Tabs for teams that you are a member of appear across the top of the AirSend screen.

Click a team tab to access the team's dashboard.  
The team dashboard displays all of the team's channels, any announcements added by the team owner or team managers, statistics about the team, and a list of the channels that are public (that any member of the team may join).

## Adding and managing team channels

If there are existing channels that you want in the team, you can add them to the team.  You can also add new channels to the team or copy existing channels.

  

 To attach an existing channel to a team

1.  Click the tab for the team, and in the upper-right corner of the screen, click **Manage Team**.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-manage-new-team.png)  
      
    The **Team Settings** dialog box opens.
2.  In the left panel, click **Channels**, and then click **Add channel**.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-no-channels.png)  
      
    When you click **Add channel**, a drop-down list that enables you to create a new channel or transfer existing channels opens.  
    **Transfer channels** lists channels that you own (but not Direct Message channels). You cannot transfer channels owned by other users or Direct Message channels to your teams.
3.  Click the channel under **Transfer channels** that you want to add to the team.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-attach-channel.png)  
      
    
4.  You must retype the name of the team into the field indicated to confirm that you want to attach the channel to the team, and then click **Save**.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-attach-warning.png)  
      
    The channel is now listed in the window:  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/2021-09-02-15-h-13-49.png)  
      
    When you close the **Team Settings** dialog box, the channel appears in the dashboard for the team.
    
    <table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><div><p><br></p></div></td><td><div><p><span><img src="../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-channel-attached.png"></span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>
    
    Attaching a channel to a team does not automatically add members of the channel to the team.  
    Members outside the team continue to be able to access the channel through the **All Channels** tab, but do not see your team's tab unless you specifically add them as members.

    The channel is now visible in the channel dashboard and the main dashboard of AirSend.

 To make a channel a public team channel

A public team channel is a channel that any member of a team can join. This differs from an AirSend public channel, which is a channel that anyone with a link to the channel can join. Public team channels appear on the team's dashboard in a Public Team Channels box even for users who have not joined them. Public team channels that a user has joined also appear on the user's team dashboard

**To make a team channel a public team channel:**

1.  Click the tab for the team, and in the upper-right corner of the screen, click **Manage Team**.

2.  In the navigation panel, click **Channels**.
3.  Hover over the three dots to the right of a channel and choose **Enable Public Team Channel**.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-enable-public-team.png)  
      
    Now the public team channel appears in the **Public Team Channels** list on the site dashboard. If the user is a member of the channel, it also appears separately on the dashboard.  
    ![](../assets/channels/teams-in-airsend/as-public-team-channel.png)

4.  If you click **Copy from channel**, a drop-down list displays the other channels that you have access to.  Choose the channel that you want to copy. The new channel will include the same files, actions, and wiki content as the copied channel, and have the same background and logo if you have customized them.  
5.  Click **Create channel**.  
    A **Share your channel** dialog box opens.   
    Note that your channel has been created at this point, so you may close this box and add members or generate a link for joining the channel later.

    1.  To add members directly to the channel, enter the names of existing AirSend users or the emails of potential users and click Enter.  
        Their names and/or emails appear below the text field.

     Note: You can enter multiple people at a time by separating the names/emails with commas.

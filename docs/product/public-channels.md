# Public channels

Use public channels to create public chat rooms for your business or personal interests.

## Create a public channel

Begin creating a public channel the same way you create other [AirSend channels](./airsend-channels.md). Play the following video to see how.

You can copy the link after the channel is created by clicking the settings icon in the channel, and in the General tab, clicking **Copy Link** next to the channel link.

**Note:** When a user joins a public channel, by default, they are a **Contributor** member, which means they have all the same privileges as a **Full contributor**, but they cannot edit the wiki or add files. 

## Adding style to your public channel

Although you are not required to customize a public channel, you can increase its appeal and engage users by inserting background and logo images and adding a description and guidelines. Watch this video to see how.

When you're ready, publish the channel's link on your company website or a site popular with target members.

# Actions in AirSend

## Adding actions

In the Actions tab of the right panel, schedule actions or tasks to be completed. After you create an action, you can assign it to specific users, add a due date, or add subtasks. When an action is complete, check it to remove it from your list of incomplete actions.  
  
::: info Note
Your [member type](/members/member-types) in a channel must be full collaborator or higher to add actions.

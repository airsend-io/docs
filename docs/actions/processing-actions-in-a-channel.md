# Processing actions in a channel

The Adding Actions video on the page [Files, Actions, and Wiki](/files-actions-and-wiki)Â shows you how to add an action and assign a user and due date.

This page shows you how to perform additional functions related to actions.

## Adding actions

In the Actions tab of the right panel, schedule actions or tasks to be completed. After you create an action, you can assign it to specific users, add a due date, or add subtasks. When an action is complete, check it to remove it from your list of incomplete actions.  
  
**Note:** Your [member type](/members/member-types) in a channel must be full collaborator or higher to add actions.

When someone creates an action in an AirSend channel and assigns it to you, you will receive an email such as:  
![](../assets/actions/processing-actions-in-a-channel/as-action-notify.png)

Inside the email is a message telling you which channel the task has been created in and a link to the channel view showing the task.

### **To view the action**

1.  If you are reading an email that has informed you about a new action, click **View** **Action**.  
    The channel opens in AirSend, and the Actions tab of the right panel is selected.  
    OR  
    If you are already in AirSend, open the channel and click the Actions tab in the right panel.  
    The new action is listed and shows any details, such as the assignees, below it.

    If an action has been assigned a due date, and the date is overdue, a red dot with an overdue notice appears below the action.
    

### To add a subtask

1.  In the Action tab, hover over the action and click the Subtask icon.

### To complete an action

1.  Open the channel in AirSend, and click the Actions tab in the right panel.

# Creating actions from messages

Since users often post messages that require some type of action, AirSend includes a feature that enables you to turn a message into an action.

For example, Sara might want to create a reminder action for this message about a meeting that she sends to David:  
  
![Message](../../assets/actions/creating-actions-from-messages/message.png)

To create an action from a message:

1.  Hover over the area to the left or the right of the message until you see the icons, then click the Action icon, and click **Remind**.  
      
    ![Message to Action icon](../../assets/actions/creating-actions-from-messages/message-to-action-icon.png)  
      
    A Create a new action dialog box opens.Â   
    The message is automatically entered into **Action description** and the creator as well as the users mentioned in the message are added to **Who**, but you can edit these values.

2.  Enter an **Action name**. It is the only required field.
3.  Assign additional users to the action by entering their names or emails into **Who.**
4.  Check **Include due date** to display **Due by** and **Time** fields.
5.  Click **Create action**.  
    The action appears in the right panel under actions.

    The member assigned to the action receives an email with information about the action and a link for opening it:

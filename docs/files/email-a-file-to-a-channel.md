# Email a file to a channel

Each channel in AirSend has an email address.Â 

<table><colgroup><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr><td><div><p>When you initially create a channel, the email address appears in the messaging section.<br><span><img src="../assets/files/email-a-file-to-a-channel/as-first-message.png"></span></p></div></td><td><div><p>When you invite someone to join a channel, they receive the email address in a message.<br><span><img src="../assets/files/email-a-file-to-a-channel/as-you-are-added.png"></span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

When you or another user sends a message to the email address with a file included in it, the file appears in the messaging section and in the attachments folder of the Files tab or Files section.

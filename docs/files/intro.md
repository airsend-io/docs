# Files in AirSend

Any file that you add to an AirSend channel is shared with all members of the channel; members can view, edit, and download any file in the channel.

**In this section:**  

You can also go directly toÂ [Files view](/files/files-view) in AirSend to add and organize files in your channels. This view exists outside of channels, and lets you work with files in multiple channels in one place.

# Create Additional folders in the Files Tab

fYou can add your own folder structure to the Files section of a channel. This procedure shows you how to add folders through the Files tab. You can also [add folders in Files view](/files/managing-files-and-folders-in-files-view) for the channel.  
In this example, we will add the following folder structure using the Files tab.

-   In progress
-   Waiting for signature
    -   Meyer signature needed
    -   Dunn signature needed
-   Complete

**To add the folder structure using the Files tab:**

1.  Open the channel.
2.  In the right-panel, click **Files**.

# Managing files and folders in Files view

### Uploading files to channel folders

1.  [Open Files view](/files/files-view).
2.  Navigate to the folder for the channel that will store the file in **My Files** or in **Shared Channels**.
    
    If you want to be able to see the file in one of the tabs for the channel, you must add it to the **files** or **wiki** folder. Otherwise, you will only be able to access the file by navigating back to Files view.

3.  Drag and drop the file onto the files or wiki folder or one of their subfolders,  
    or click **Upload File** and select a file or drag and drop a file over the main section of the screen.

    The file is uploaded to the folder and appears in the main section of the screen, which displays the contents of the folder.

    If you leave Files view and open the channel, you can see the file in the Files and Links tab when you click the Files sub-tab or, if you added it to the Wiki folder, when you edit the wiki.

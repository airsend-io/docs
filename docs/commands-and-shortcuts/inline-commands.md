# Inline commands

There are a variety of commands that you can enter directly in a channel's chat bar - and the list is growing.

**To enter a slash command:**

1.  Open a channel.
2.  In the chat bar, enter / (a forward slash).  
    A list of available commands appears above the chat bar.Â   
    The commands you see depend on your [member type](/members/member-types).

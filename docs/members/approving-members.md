3.  To approve a user, click **Accept**.  
    The user receives a message that they have been added to the channel. Now when they enter the channel link, the channel opens.

    AirSend immediately creates a direct message channel for you and the user, and you can immediately send a message to the user.Â   
    The user remains in the **Requires Approval** tab until you accept or reject the membership request.

### To reject the membership request

1.  To reject the user's request for membership to the channel, click the three dots to the right of the **Accept** button, and choose **Reject Request**.  
    The user is removed from the **Requires Approval** tab.  
    AirSend does not notify the user that their membership has been rejected. To notify the user, you must send a message manually.

# Meeting in AirSend

In AirSend, you can meet with the members of a channel or have a public meeting that anyone with the meeting link can join.  
  

## Meeting with Channel Members

To begin a meeting with all members of a channel, open the channel, click the phone icon at the top of the screen, and choose **Start meeting for the channel members**. The other members of the channel will hear an alert letting them know that a meeting has begun, and receive a notification in the channel with a link for joining the meeting.

As soon as you start the meeting, you'll see your image on the screen with an alert that you've joined the meeting. You wil lalso see a red phone icon overlaying the channel in the channel navigation pane. As other members join the meeting, their faces will appear on the screen, and you can begin talking.

## Moderator Actions

A meeting moderator has some control over the actions of other members of a meeting.

### Who is a meeting moderator?

-   In a public meeting, the moderator is the user who started the call.
-   In private (channel) meeting, a moderators are members with the roles manager, admin, and owner.

### What can moderators do?:

When a moderator clicks the three dots (...) in the icon for a user in the lower portion of the screen, a drop-down list with possible actions opens.  
A moderator always has the option of removing the user from the meeting. Other actions are listed depending on whether the user is using audio or video, or screen sharing, 

**Available Actions**

-   Mute microphone
-   Disable video
-   Disable screen sharing
-   Remove from the meeting  
      
    ![](./assets/meetings/as-moderator-options.png)  
       
    Although, as a moderator, you may stop an action, you cannot prevent the user from doing it again. For example, if you mute a user's microphone, the user may turn it back on, or if you remove a member from a meeting, the user may rejoin the meeting.

## Public Meetings

You can begin a public meeting from a channel or from the dashboard, but in either case, it is open to anyone who has the meeting link. If you open the meeting from a channel, members of the channel are not automatically invited to the meeting.

1.  Hover over the phone icon at the top of the page and click **Start public meeting**.  
    ![](./assets/meetings/as-start-public.png)  
      
    Your meeting begins, and the link for the meeting is shown.  
    ![](./assets/meetings/as-welcome-public.png)  
      
    
2.  Click **Copy Link**.
3.  Send the link to anyone you want to invite to the meeting.  
    When invitees click the link, the meeting screen opens and they are able to participate.

## Public meeting chats

You begin a chat from a public meeting the same way you begin a chat in a private meeting - by clicking the Chat icon in the lower-right corner of the screen.  
![](./assets/meetings/as-chat-public.png)  
  
In a private meeting, the channel chat opens, but since a public meeting is not tied to a channel, the chat takes place in the right panel:

The content in the right panel is not automatically saved, but you can save it as a text file by clicking the download button at the bottom of the chat:

### I can’t screen share

    If you don’t see the screen share icon, that means your browser does not support this feature.

# AirSend Docs

Powered by VitePress, the AirSend Docs helps to centralize all the technical and user experience information about the tool.

## Contributing

The content is written in Markdown format located in `docs`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, yarn is preferred as package manager:

```
yarn install
yarn run docs:dev
```

This project requires Node.js to be `v14.0.0` or higher, because we use new JavaScript features in our code, such as optional chaining.
